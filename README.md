#### About: 
In this version of ACUvid, I'm shifting from the remaking of a flight entertainment system to simulating a streaming apps. 
This version maintains a similar structure to its predecessor while making few tweaks and adding new features to resemble that of other streaming apps.

#### Features:
1. Switched font family from 'Berlin Sans FB' to 'Zen Dots'.
2. Tweaked the sign up/in page to reduce spacing issues.
3. Added a quick summary/preview for each hub before opening.
4. Removed the 'Latest' and 'Upcoming' category from homepage.
5. Moved all navigation tabs including profiles and settings into a single page for quick navigation.
6. Redesigned the search tab and added basic search functionality.
7. Added details for the Premium tab.
8. Added a contact tab.
9. Implemented a structure for the show hubs.
10. Renamed 'Customer Support' to 'Help center'.
11. Replaced the custom form field in the Help Center with the default text area as the former was overly complex.
12. Added a catalog page to view all shows.
13. Added page for displaying a show's details.
14. Added a watch page with a custom designed player.
